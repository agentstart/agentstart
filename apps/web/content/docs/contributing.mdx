description: A concise guide to contributing to AgentStart
---

Thank you for your interest in contributing to AgentStart! This short guide outlines the recommended workflow so you can start shipping improvements quickly and safely.

## Getting Started

Before opening a pull request, skim a few key resources:

- Review open [issues](https://github.com/agentstart/agentstart/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/agentstart/agentstart/pulls)

## Development Setup

Get your local workspace ready in a few steps:

<Callout type="warn">
  Make sure you have the latest [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) LTS and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) installed.
</Callout>

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### 1. Fork the repository

    Visit [https://github.com/agentstart/agentstart](https://github.com/agentstart/agentstart) and click the **Fork** button.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### 2. Clone your fork

    ```bash
    # Replace YOUR-USERNAME with your GitHub username
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/agentstart.git
    cd agentstart
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### 3. Install dependencies

    AgentStart uses pnpm workspaces. Install everything with:

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Making Changes

Once you have an idea for a contribution, follow this workflow:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### 1. Create a feature branch

    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git pull upstream main
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### 2. Start the development servers

    Run the packages you need:

    ```bash
    # Start all packages in watch mode
    pnpm run dev

    # or, start the docs site in isolation
    pnpm run dev:web
    ```

    The documentation lives in `apps/web`; use the second command when iterating on docs-only contributions.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### 3. Implement your changes

    - Update the relevant packages or docs
    - Add or adjust tests when behaviour changes
    - Keep your branch focused on a single change
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Issues and Bug Fixes

- Look for `good first issue` labels in [GitHub issues](https://github.com/agentstart/agentstart/issues)
- When reporting bugs, include reproduction steps, expected behaviour, and environment details
- Comment on an issue before starting work to avoid duplicate efforts

### Framework Integrations

Contributions that add or expand framework adapters are welcome:

- Prefer framework-agnostic building blocks when possible
- Keep integration code small and composable
- All official integrations live in the monorepo under `packages/`

### Memory & Tooling Extensions

- Open an issue first for core memory adapters or runtime tools so we can discuss design details
- Community tooling (e.g. example scripts) can live outside the monorepo—link to them in the docs if they help others

### Documentation

- Fix typos and clarify existing copy
- Add runnable examples whenever you introduce new APIs
- Keep the docs aligned with the current codebase (update both together)

## Testing

AgentStart uses Vitest and pnpm-powered scripts. Place test files next to the code they cover and run the shared scripts before submitting changes.

### Testing Best Practices

- Run `pnpm run lint`, `pnpm run typecheck`, and `pnpm run test` before opening a PR
- Add or update tests alongside feature or bug-fix work
- Keep commits and pull requests focused
- Update documentation to reflect behaviour changes

## Need Help?

We're happy to help unblock you:

- Open an [issue](https://github.com/agentstart/agentstart/issues) with questions
- Mention project maintainers directly if you need a review

Thanks again for contributing to AgentStart!
