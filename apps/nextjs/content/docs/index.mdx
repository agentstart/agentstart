title: Welcome to Agent Stack
description: The first fullstack template designed for AI agents. Zero config, maximum efficiency, true vibe coding.
---

## Introduction

Agent Stack is a modern, AI-first fullstack template built with Next.js, designed specifically for AI agents and developers who want to build quickly and efficiently.

## Key Features

- **AI-First Design**: Every aspect optimized for AI agent understanding and usage
- **Zero Configuration**: Get started immediately with sensible defaults
- **Full Type Safety**: End-to-end TypeScript with oRPC for type-safe APIs
- **Modern Stack**: Next.js 15, React 19, Tailwind CSS 4, and more
- **Built-in Authentication**: Powered by Better Auth with social logins
- **Database Ready**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL support
- **Payment Integration**: Stripe integration via Better Auth plugin

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/agent-stack.git

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Setup environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# Run the development server
bun dev
```

## Architecture Overview

The project follows a monorepo structure using Turborepo:

```
agent-stack/
├── apps/
│   └── nextjs/        # Next.js application
├── packages/
│   ├── api/          # oRPC API routes
│   ├── auth/         # Authentication logic
│   ├── db/           # Database schema and utilities
│   └── config/       # Shared configuration
└── docs/             # Documentation (you are here!)
```

## Why Agent Stack?

Traditional templates are designed for developers, focusing on feature reuse to save development time. Agent Stack is different - it's designed for AI agents, prioritizing:

1. **Token Efficiency**: Clear structure and documentation to minimize token usage
2. **Agent Direction**: Providing clear guidance for AI-driven development
3. **Vibe Coding Quality**: Enhancing the quality of AI-assisted coding
